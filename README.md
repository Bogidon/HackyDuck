# HackyDuck

## Inspiration

Having been raised on exclusively high-level languages, we decided to forsake our privileged automatic data typing and functional schema and choose a more elegant tool. Drawing on the power and allure of the consoles and computers of old, our team endeavored to create an awesome game running on the old but trusted 6502 assembly language. We choose to write Hacky Duck in 6502 Assembly as a challenge.

## What it does

 Hacky Duck is a game where you play as a brave duck trying to avoid treacherous green pillars in low-level assembly.

## How I built it

## Challenges I ran into
Assembly, with its manual memorty management thoroughly tests your knowledge of computer science fundamentals, much moreso than a more conventional language.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We taught ourselves 6502 Assembly within 24 hours. 

## What I learned
Assembly is hard
Assembly is tough
**Assembly is the best**

## What's next for Hacky Duck
More levels, compiled versions for classic game consoles
